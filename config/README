Please read this document before modifying any of the files. 
You need the following properly JSON formatted files in this directory:
- users.json
- db.json
 
The first is 'users.json', with a format similar to:
{
  "userName1"    : { "passkey" : "generatedPasskey1", "groups" : ["groupName1"] },
  "userName2"    : { "passkey" : "generatedPasskey2", "groups" : ["groupName1", "groupnName2"] }
}

Important:
Please note that the passkey is not just some random text that will be supplied as is
by the user. The passkey is a combination of cryptographic one-way hashes of one
auto-generated salt and one auto-generated password for the GMQ. In order to generate
psswords and passkeys for new users a tool has been provided for you, in the 'scripts/tools/'
folder. The only way to add new users or change passwords, is by generating them using the
supplied tool (thor gmq:generate:password or thor gmq:generate:user username group1, group2).

What follows is an example of a properly formatted 'users.json' file:
{
  "rci"         : { "passkey" : "9b9b2a8ddf62329a6031d8d2724275c5e1daa72c01dbd2026a83615f",
                    "groups" : ["sijc"] },
  "cap_webapp"	: { "passkey" : "299a18a088f2e1e08074863cc03f6b699307eb895fdcd5c2c404e294",
                    "groups" : ["prgov"] },
  "cap_worker"	: { "passkey" : "299a18a088f2e1e08074863cc03f6b699307eb895fdcd5c2c404e294",
                    "groups" : ["worker"] },
  "***REMOVED***"   : { "passkey" : "759528379170710b70d0e17e62cd142931db535d07bcb8cb4bffe6d9",
		    "groups" : ["admin"] }
}

The second is 'db.json' which will contain the configuration for Store systems like so:
{
  "driver"  : "synchrony",
  "servers" : {
              "redis01"  : {
                              "user"     : "user1",
                              "password" : "password1",
                              "host"     : "localhost",
                              "port"     : 6379
              },
              "redis02" :  {
                              "user"     : "user2",
                              "password" : "password2",
                              "host"     : "localhost",
                              "port"     : 6380
              }
  }
}

-----
A restart is required after any configuration files, due to the file being loaded
in memory to avoid heavy IO use.
